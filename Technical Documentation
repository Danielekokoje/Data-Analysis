# Premier League Champions Dashboard - Technical Documentation

## Data Model Overview

The Premier League Champions dashboard is built on a carefully structured data model focused on championship data from 1992-2023. The model incorporates multiple related tables to enable rich analytical capabilities.

### Core Tables

1. **Champions Table**
   - Primary fact table containing championship records
   - Fields: Season, Year, Team, Points, Manager, Win Streak, etc.
   - Granularity: One record per championship season

2. **Teams Dimension**
   - Contains team attributes and metadata
   - Enables consistent team naming and grouping
   - Includes historical team information

3. **Managers Dimension**
   - Contains manager information and career statistics
   - Links managers across multiple championship seasons
   - Allows analysis of manager performance across different periods

4. **Seasons Dimension**
   - Contains season-specific attributes
   - Enables time-based analysis and filtering

## Key DAX Measures

```
// Calculate consecutive title streaks
Title Streak = 
VAR CurrentTeam = SELECTEDVALUE(Champions[Team])
VAR CurrentYear = SELECTEDVALUE(Champions[Year])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Champions[Season]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Champions),
        Champions[Team] = CurrentTeam &&
        Champions[Year] <= CurrentYear &&
        Champions[Year] > CurrentYear - 3
    )
)

// Calculate win percentage for managers
Manager Win Percentage = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT(Champions[Season]), FILTER(Champions, Champions[Manager] = SELECTEDVALUE(Champions[Manager]))),
    CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Seasons[Season]), FILTER(Seasons, Seasons[Manager] = SELECTEDVALUE(Champions[Manager])))
) * 100

// Points trend analysis
Points Running Average = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Champions[Points]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Champions),
        Champions[Year] <= MAX(Champions[Year]) &&
        Champions[Year] >= MAX(Champions[Year]) - 3
    )
)
```

## Data Preparation Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Championship data was gathered from official Premier League statistics
   - Manager information supplemented from multiple reliable sources
   - Historical points data verified against official records

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Standardization of team names to account for rebranding (e.g., Wimbledon/MK Dons)
   - Creation of derived fields (win streaks, consecutive titles)
   - Calculation of managerial statistics

3. **Data Quality Assurance**
   - Cross-verification of championship records against multiple sources
   - Validation of all statistical calculations
   - Review for anomalies or inconsistencies

## Visualization Design Principles

1. **Color Scheme**
   - Primary league colors (purple and white) for header and navigation
   - Team-specific colors for team-related visualizations
   - Consistent color mapping across related visualizations

2. **Layout Structure**
   - Top section devoted to key performance indicators
   - Center section focused on chronological and comparative analysis
   - Bottom section dedicated to detailed tabular information
   - Right panel for filtering and context selection

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Cross-filtering enabled between visualizations
   - Season and team slicers for focused analysis
   - Tooltips with additional contextual information
   - Drill-through capabilities for detailed exploration

## Performance Optimization

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Strategic use of calculated tables vs. measures
   - Implementation of appropriate filter context
   - Careful management of relationship cardinality

2. **Visual Optimization**
   - Limited use of high-resource visuals
   - Implementation of pagination for large data sets
   - Strategic use of filters to limit data rendering

## Future Technical Enhancements

1. **Data Expansion**
   - Integration with match-level data for deeper analysis
   - Addition of player statistics for championship teams
   - Incorporation of financial data for cost-per-point analysis

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implementation of what-if parameters for scenario analysis
   - Development of predictive models for future championships
   - Integration of AI-driven insights for pattern recognition

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Development of custom visuals for more intuitive analysis
   - Creation of guided analytics paths for common questions
   - Implementation of natural language query capabilities
